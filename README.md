# Polar_platform
 
This is a simple simulation platform for 5G NR Polar code simulation.
It is based on Matlab 5G Toolbox. It utilizeobjects and functions of it's New Radio set so it mostly follows default toolbox notation. One can find additional explanation on the 5G New Radio Polar Coding page in the 5G Toolbox documentation. I tried to keep as much parameters default as possible to avoid the code overload. To run the simulation just run this script.
